// Build a new smaller docker image by modifying the same Dockerfile and name it webapp-color and tag it lite.
// Hint: Find a smaller base image for python:3.6. Make sure the final image is less than 150MB.

// solution
//In the webapp-color directory, run the ls -l command to list the Dockerfile and other files.
// And modify Dockerfile to use python:3.6-alpine image and then build using docker build -t webapp-color:lite .
$ vi Dockerfile
$ docker build -t webapp-color:lite .

// Run an instance of the new image webapp-color:lite and publish port 8080 on the container to 8383 on the host.
$ docker run -p 8383:8080 webapp-color:lite
